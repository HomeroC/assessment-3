    <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p id="summary">
           I am currently learning to become a Software Developer! I'm mainly interested in web development to build awesome sites and web apps. Besides learning different coding languages, I have amazing soft skills too! I am a well organized and detail oriented individual. I hope to work for a big name company like Google or Meta, but I don't mind starting off at a start-up!
